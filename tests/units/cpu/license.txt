Terms and conditions
====================

0) Definitions

  Throughout  this  license,  the  terms 'package', 'source', 'code',
  'work' and  'source files' refer  to  the  set  of files  which claim
  to be distributed under this license, be they named as alpha, beta or
  final release.

  'You' refers to  the licensee, or person using these sources, where
  'using' is a generic term including compiling the package's source
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  'program' or `executable'.
  This  program is  referred to  as  'a program  using this package'.

  This  license applies  to all packages distributed  under this license,
  including  all  source   code,  binaries  and  documentation,  unless
  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its original, unmodified form
  as  distributed in the original archive. If you are  unsure whether
  or not a particular  file is covered by this license, you must contact
  me to verify this.

  This package is copyright (C) 2000, Thomas Schatzl. All rights
  reserved except as specified below.


1) Warranty

  THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER

  WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES
  CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THIS PACKAGE.

  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
  accept  it.   However,  as  this package  is  copyrighted
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
  author, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  package
  you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this
  license.

2) Redistribution

      accompanying  documentation.   The  copyright notices  of  the
      unaltered, original  files must be preserved in  all copies of
      source files.
